# adding a new food item to the usda db

`/food`
--------

### POST -- adds food item to usda db

Example request:

```
{ "food": {
    "name": "new food",
    "nutrients": [
      { "amount": 24,
        "nutrient": {
          "id": 203,
        }
      },
      ...
    ],
  },
  "amount": 40,
}
```

The amount for the whole food is the 'reference quantity'. This is a number of
grams for which the given nutrient breakdown is true.
This makes it more convenient for reading off a nutrition facts label.

Response:

```
{ "id": nnn }
```

Returns the id of the newly created food.

`/nutrients`
-------------

### GET -- retrieves documented nutrients filtered by user input

Query string parameters:
* `search`: returned nutrients must contain this as a substring

Response:

```
[ {
    "name" : "Protein",
    "id" : 203,
    "unit" : "g"
  },
 ...
]
```

`/food/:id/weights`
----------

### GET -- retrieves available weights for a food

(done, check `get_weights`)

The `food_id` is specified as part of the URL.

Example return object:
```
{ "weights": [ <list of weight objects> ] }
```

and each weight object is
```
{ "name": <string>, "seq_num": <int>, "grams": <int> }
```
`grams` indicates how many grams are in one unit of `seq_num` (ex 1 cup = 244g)
The `seq_num` uniquely identifies this quantity type for the `food_id`.

`/search`
---------

### GET -- lists foods and recipes
(See `list_foods_recipes`)

Query string parameters:
* `for`: specify search terms, space separated words
* `restrict_to` optional: either `food` or `recipe` and only returns those types
  of results.

e.g.
`/search?for=beef%20raw%20lean`

Returns:
```
{ "results": [ <list of result objects> ] }
```

and each `result object` is
```
{ "type": <"food" or "recipe">, "id": <int>, "name": <string> }
```
e.g.
```
{ "type": "recipe", "id": 2, "name": "delicious pasta salad" }
```

`/recipes`
----------

### POST -- creates (or modifies) a recipe
# done (create ONLY) see `insert_to_db`

Example request

```
{
  "name": "protein shake",
  "ingredients": [
    { "food_id": 10017
    , "amount": 2
    , "display_unit": "cup"
    },
    { "food_id": 78121
    , "amount": 2
    , "display_unit": "cup"
    }
  ]
}
```

For modifying an existing recipe, the object would have an extra key `"id"`
saying which recipe should be overwritten. In that case, all ingredients that
used to belong to the recipe are deleted and the given ingredients are added.

If the request succeeds, return a JSON object like

```
{ "id": 5 }
```

which just specifies the ID of the recipe that was created/modified.

`/eat`
--------

### GET -- retrieves nutrient tracking data

The selected tracking data are summed and returned.

Query string parameters are used to filter the tracking data.
* `consumer` string: select tracking data for a specific consumer
* `start` ISO-8601 string: start time to filter from
* `end` ISO-8601 string: end time to filter to

**NOTE**: The backend is expecting time strings in the format produced by JS's
Date.prototype.toISOString().

The returned data is a JSON object whose keys are nutrient names and whose
values are tuples (lists). The first tuple component is a number and the second
is a string that identifies the units for that number.

### POST -- adds a nutrition tracking entry

Example request:

```
{ "consumer": "Jake",
  "edible": <edible object>,
  "weight": <weight object>,
}
```
(This object is called an `eaten`.)

where an `edible object` is
```
{ "type": "food", "id": <int> }
```
or
```
{ "type": "recipe", "id": <int> }
```

The `type` field specifies how to interpret the `id` field.

A `weight object` is
```
{ "amount": <float>, "seq_num": <int> }
```
and refers to a `seq_num` identifier for a specific weight associated with the food or recipe.

Example request, for consuming a recipe
```
{ "consumer": "Eric",
  "edible": { "type": "recipe", "id": 1 },
  "weight": { "amount": 1.5, "seq_num": 2 },
}
```

**NOTE:** The sequence numbers `0` and `-1` are special since they do not
correspond to entries in the `weight` table. Instead, the interpretation is a
number of grams and a total recipe fraction, respectively.
This means that `-1` is not valid as `seq_num` for a food, but instead valid
only for recipes.

`/macros`
---------

### GET -- calculate macros for a given quantity of an edible

Query string parameters:
* `id`: identifies the edible
* `type`: `"recipe"` or `"food"`, identifies the type of edible
* `seq_num`: identifies the unit of measurement used
* `amount`: identifies the
